Hi Aditya,

> majority are facing this problem!

I am curious as to how you ascertained that more than 50% of the students that attempted Project failed to submit? Our backend data shows that expected submissions were largely inline with past terms. In other words Diwali made little statistically significant difference. As aspiring data scientists we should be careful with our words we use when we make statements.

Kind regards
