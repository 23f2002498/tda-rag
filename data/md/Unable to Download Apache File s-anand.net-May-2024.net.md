Hi Satish,

Q1 to Q8, of GA3 all have the same file. It does not matter which OS you use (I use all 3).  
Click on the link provided, it will get you to this page, click on the download button:

Then you should get a file like this:

And in Mac OS if you double click it, the file will automatically get extracted and you will get the resulting file as seen in the screen shot above.

The file name in the title of your post is wrong btw.  
It should be `s-anand.net-May-2024`

Then you are able to easily process the file using your favourite package. (Note, the file is not a csv)

The above screenshots were all using Mac OS and the chrome browser.

Regards
