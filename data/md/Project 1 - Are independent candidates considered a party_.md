Q12: Which party exhibited the most significant increase in vote share from one election to the next consecutive one? Exclude parties that did not contest in the subsequent election.

Q13: What was the increase in vote share for the party that showed the most significant improvement from one election to the next consecutive one? if the vote share increased from 30 percent to 65 percent, the improvement is 35.

How do we deal with Independent candidates?  
Are independent candidates considered one party?  
If so does that mean we sum their total vote for an election and call it independent?

OR are individual candidates discarded for these questions since they do not belong to any party? (And the question specifically asks which **“party”** improved the most between elections and by what margin?)

As of right now I have made the assumption that independents do not belong to any party and therefore are discarded for the sake of these two particular questions.

Any clarification on this would be great. Thanks.

God bless.
