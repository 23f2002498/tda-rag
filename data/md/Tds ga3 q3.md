Hi Tarun,

Could you share the question, as it is parameterised for all students. Also typically if you are getting several questions wrong, then its far more likely that the logic you have employed has errors.

**I have looked at your code and presumed that it is /hindimp3/ and Tuesday. I do get the correct answer in the range you provided.**

Also if you wanted help with code, it is not practical to debug your code when you share screen shots. It is far more kinder (indeed almost a prerequisite for code that is more than a couple of lines) to those who might help you to actually encapsulate your code in block quotes.

A good example of how to ask help, is like how this fellow student has demonstrated:

> In Q-3, Every time I am getting different when I hit the link for collab notebook to fix the code and get back to the page light\_pixels = np.sum(lightness > 0.246) this value '0.246' is changing every time that means window is reloading every time so I am sure answers of my last two question would be change also then what to do in that case
> import numpy as np
> from PIL import Image
> from google.colab import files
> import colorsys
> # There is a mistake inâ€¦

You are likely to get much more help if you do so.

Regards
