Hi Narendran

Okay a little bit of advice on Internet. Always make a habit of citing your source as practice because not all sources are equal and it helps to understand the context in which the information is written.

With regards to currency:

Here is a dataset

You are working in an exchange house. I as a customer would like to buy 1000 Swiss Francs.  
Can you tell me how much Dollars its costs to buy 1000 Swiss Francs?

If currency was only real data type, then you should be able to answer the question with the above dataset. They have all the real value exchange rates.

How many components does currency have?

If currency is only real then how do you distinguish between Francs and dollars?

In a spreadsheet the numerical component is recorded as a real. So it behaves like a real and has properties of a real.

But without its symbol (which often in local instances is understood or implicit) its just a number.

If i gave you two columns and did not give you a header stating Rs and $ you would not be able to process the data meaningfully. Hence to give the currency meaning it has to be composite.

Another approach to understand.

Imagine you are tasked with identifying the average amount of money that passengers carry with them at an international airport. So a survery is conducted and one data point looks like this

20  
35.50  
5000

Can you tell me the total amount of Rupees this person is carrying?

Without its first component i.e. its symbol, the above data point cannot be processed.

Because $20 is not the same as Rs 20 even though both are represented by the same R component.

Hence Currency is considered composite data.

I hope that helps  
Happy Learning!
