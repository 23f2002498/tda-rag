Hi Aliza,

The most common reasons are:

your repository csv files do not have ‘true’ and ‘false’ set correctly (not True / False etc). Which also means there can be no NaNs in those columns. Everything must be either true or false.  
Once the csv files are corrected the repo needs to be updated in the submission.

Q13 is regression of followers on word count. Make sure the correct columns are assigned for x and y values. Because you will get very different results depending on what you choose as the dependent value and the independent value.

Kind regards
