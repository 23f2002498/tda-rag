That is why the word *before* was mentioned to give *extra clarity.*

What do you think the word before means? If you say its meant to represent a range, the question anyway says **from** 16:00 and it would have terminated at the word **to**.

But instead for extra clarity the question said **from â€¦ until before**

But EVEN if the word *before* was not mentioned the question would still be correctly assuming that 23:00 is excluded,

The legal definition of `until`: [ref. Law Insider Dictionary](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/until)

> to but excluding
