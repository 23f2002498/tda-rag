Scatter plots are often used in the real world for bivariate outlier detection through the use of z scores, residuals in regression analysis, elliptic envelope (multivariate normal distribution). All these are precise mathematical tools that can be visually mapped on the scatter plot to detect outliers.

Resolution : Q444 will be given marks for both box plots as well as scatter plots being marked as the correct answer.
