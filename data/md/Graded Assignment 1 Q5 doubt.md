Hi 21f1001102,

We have noted your query and have decided to award all students 1 mark to those who chose data.gov.cy.

Please refer to the official announcements page for further clarification:

> 1. Cyprus data portal:
> Both data.gov.cy and www.data.gov.cy are the correct options.
> Decision:
> Students who answered either option will receive 1 mark.
> 2. Azerbaijan data portal:
> The correct answer is opendata.az which is not an option
> The closest is www.opendata.az
> Decision:
> Students are expected to get to the closest answer since both are equivalent, and none of the other options are close enough.
> \therefore No change to grading.

Thanks for letting us know.
