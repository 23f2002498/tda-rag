Hi Jwala,

Your query has been officially reviewed.

Shanghai for OSM 778910398 has min lat 31.0723437 and Bangalore for OSM 3401391999 has min lat 12.8167936. You searched for ?q=Bangalore, India and picked the wrong OSM ID from that â€“ **even though the last 4 digits of the OSM ID are mentioned in the question.**

Kind regards
