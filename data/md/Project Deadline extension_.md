Hi Bahni and Arushi,

I have raised this question with operations and they felt ample time was given for project so therefore there is no need for an extension. It deployment was delayed by three days and therefore its deadline was also delayed by three days. Furthermore GA5 and GA6 was also delayed so therefore students were given a breather with the delay of those GAs.

Kind regards
