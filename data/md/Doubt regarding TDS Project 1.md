Hi Shrindhi,

> Clarifications on Project Questions:
> Q1 to Q14: Use both state name and constituency name for answering these questions.
> Q8: Count every deposit loss (even if its the same candidate that has lost the deposit multiple times) eg. if Carlton lost the 2024 election and the 2020 election, then that counts as 2 losses.
> Q15 to Q20: Use state name for answering these questions. Therefore your target dataset is all the constituencies in the state. Some of these questions may involve your constituency iâ€¦

This usually solves most issues that students encounter (especially about the part of how to create your submission files.)

Hope that helps  
Regards
