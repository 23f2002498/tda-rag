There are no changes because the corrections have not been pushed. These are not individual fixes. Its a system wide problem, hence everyone is being rescored. We are not fixing each individual studentâ€™s problem. There are over 1000+ rescores to be done for GA4, GA5, GA6, Project 1, Project 2, ROE.

Today we will be pushing the corrected scores after 10 am
