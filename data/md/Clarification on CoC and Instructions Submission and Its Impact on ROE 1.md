With regards to marks, there was email sent out to every student that only the latest ROE would count. NOT best of 2. Please refer to email sent on 22nd June. Also the announcement is available in portal.

As far as whether your submissions were fine, the exam portal of ROE 1 was available for viewing after sometime to examine what questions you got correct or wrong. So that was easy to be verified by yourself.

If you still have some operations related problem then please send a support ticket to the support portal (not email).

Regards
