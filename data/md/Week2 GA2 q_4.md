The web archive website has been hacked and therefore we are not able to check it. However, I can safely say that usually if the page has Javascript enabled you will get one extra item and without you will get one less. (I made the same mistake when solving this GA). Turning off the Javascript (just for this page) usually fixes the problem.

(Note: I have not checked your actual script due to the page outage - but the symptoms of the two different answers are usually what makes the difference).

Kind regards,
