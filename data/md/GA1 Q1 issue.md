Hi Ritik,

I checked your GA1 it works correctly. You have the wrong sha256sum because there is an actual error in your process.

Did you try to create a small test file to see what your command actually does?

In particular expression inside sed?

Your almost there.  
There is a small error in it.

Kind regards
