Hi Aditya, the mock was not meant to be a thoroughly validated or vetted mock. It was just to give a sense of the type of difficulty and the type of questions that you might see in the end term and it was not exhaustive. Your best approach will be do watch the TA revision sessions and cover everything that has been mentioned in the lectures (including basic functions of the various libraries, what tools are used for what purpose, etc)

You can even use the virtual TDS GPT TA to generate you a mock as it was used to assist in generating the final end term paper. It has all the source material uploaded into it including the transcripts of the lectures. Just give it an appropriate prompt and ask it to generate 40 questions for end term.
