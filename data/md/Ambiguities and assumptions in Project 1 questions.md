Hi anupam,

The dataset has never changed. It has always been the same. Only the questions clarified and the assigned state and constituencies were reassigned. This was due to the assignments being parameterised against an older version of the dataset, hence many students (my internal analysis showed that maybe upto as much as 8 percent of the students) got ac names that were non existent or did not meet our requirements for the questions being asked.

Once again sorry for the deployment issues. But being able to catch it early means less issues for students in the long run and thatâ€™s why we worked for days flat out to iron out most of the issues before deployment and then post deployment we opted for the best overall outcome for all students.

At the heart of it all, our goal has always been to provide TDS students with the best learning and evaluation experience that we can, given various constraints that we have to work with and in cooperation and coordination with the team and with many moving parts that makes TDS unique compared to any other course at the diploma level.

Kind regards
