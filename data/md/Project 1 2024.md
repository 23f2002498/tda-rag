Hi Smita,

We were aware of the issue within hours of the deployment. Sorry I was unable to make an official response before today. Please refer to this post.

> Hi Anupam,
> We had not yet had a chance to discuss several outstanding issues which were raised on Sunday during the live TA session with the instructors and Anand sir. So it would have been inappropriate for me to give a response before there was an official decision on what to do.
> The question set will be clarified. And all students be given a new constituency name and state to work with because there was a deployment problem on the back end that came to light after we had published. Thereforâ€¦

Kind regards
