Please check your email, you would have received and official email from us with your scores for each of your GAs. The dashboard will always have some delay because the portal and our site are not linked, thats why we send out the mail.

We currently have on record for you 10, 7 and 9.5 respectively for you GA scores.

Every student has the same issue. Its not unique to a few. All of them will have the scores pushed to dashboard by the operations team at the same time. The official email from us is your proof of your actual score. Dashboard scores will be updated in due time.
