# Is it fair to consider 20% weightage of such exam which is impossible to solve in given time (i.e. ROE)

TDS ROE is a reality check on your true skills. Rather than face FAANG type tests when it really matters and get a shock that you are at the bottom of the pile, it is better you face reality now in an environment that does not unduly penalises you.

> This situation is causing CGPAs to drop significantly.

While that seems like a nice sound bite, let’s look at the data as true data scientists rather than let emotion lead our thoughts.

If you get an S in TDS, its weight to your total Diploma CGPA will be 5.55%.  
When you consider that ROE is worth 20% of that, the overall effect on your diploma CGPA at BEST is 1.11% if you score 100% in it. The TRUE effect **is lower** if you take into consideration you can offset at least 25% of that loss with bonus questions (worth 5% of the TDS grade)!

> This is a very serious issue

A little over dramatic a statement considering the data we now have considered above. The reality is the ROE is worth 0.83% of your overall diploma CGPA (and that too this is the worst case, i.e. for direct diploma students! For those that started from foundation its impact **is even smaller! 0.52%)**

What is my opinion on ROE? It made me a better student. I was truly humbled by the experience. It gave me a realistic view of my abilities and the level I need to attain so that I can be confident in the value I am adding to the client. Who is the client? The businesses I might deal with, the companies I contract for.

If there was no value attached to the ROE (i.e. you have no stake in it) then all the evidence points to one very simple truth. Nearly no one taking it seriously.

> many of us are struggling to maintain good CGPAs to progress to the degree level.

My mother has always said one thing to me. Its only an undergraduate degree. If you are struggling in year 2, then stop wasting your time, its not meant for you.

ROE is not harsh. ROE is like my mother’s very wise advice. There are many, many examples of students dropping out of university and being successful in life. **Do not waste your time,** its more valuable than anything you possess. If you are struggling, to even maintain a 6 CGPA requirement to enter the degree level because of an ROE that contributes > 0.834%, then the very best advice you will ever receive from me is: Do not waste your time with this degree.

I say this with all sincerity and truth. I am living evidence, as are many others, you do not need this degree to succeed in life. The reason I am doing this degree is because I realised that I actually enjoy this course and I find real value from it and hope to make a difference for good with what I learn from it.

Although it is called the impossible exam, our data shows that there are several students that have done well in the ROE. ROE is not harsh. It’s a reality check, its a mother’s advice and a very inexpensive, truthful and effective one.

Humbly for your kind consideration
