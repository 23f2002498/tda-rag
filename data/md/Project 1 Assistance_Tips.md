Hi Amodh,

Do not clean up spellings of candidate names or constituency names (the nos however are not part of their name, logically). Also there may be other objective data manipulations that can be cleaned up if the dataset is logically examined. There will be no cleanups that are subjective (i.e. there are no data cleaning that require personal judgement).

Q.17 is for the whole the state, not the whole country.
