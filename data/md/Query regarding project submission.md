Hi aaromal,

Usually this error can crop up for different reasons.

If you were unable to commit from your system, the workaround was to just directly upload the file on github manually as some students have mentioned in earlier discourse threads.

Secondly, if you did manage to upload it, and you were still getting the error, its because some students use the url with .git at the end. This also leads to errors. (remove the .git in the submission on project page) Also mentioned in earlier discourse threads.

Thirdly, if you did not scrape the data correctly and it does not have the expected number of users then it will also throw the same error.

Kind regards
