It should be a csv file as per the instructions provided. The submission section has this weird anomaly where it says zip (although you have to select zip, its just a meaningless label. Just make sure your file is csv.

To be perfectly frank after 2 years, you would think that someone would correct this confusing UI element but its not deemed important and therefore student confusion persists and thus support time is taken for a trivial issue that could be fixed with a simple ui update.

May the great tradition of hopeless UI design continue. (the downside of not having actual UI experts is a real hidden cost drag on any business and enterprise that no one cares to calculate, despite having staff that boast of great big degrees in Business and half a dozen certificates from so called top institutions: Think of the paid man hours that can be saved with good UI, robust workflows, that reduces the number of support staff needed to solve a trivial issue you have raised). Rant over ![:slight_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/slight_smile.png?v=12 ":slight_smile:") (not directed at you of course, just to the powers that be).
