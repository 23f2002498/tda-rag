Hi Akash,

The subject of the email is:  
[May 2024 TDS] ROE Data

It was sent last night at 20:21  
This was the email that was sent to everyone:

The data for tomorrow’s TDS ROE (Sat 20 Jul 8 pm IST) is at [roe.7z - Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CKBFzo-NXupLTkzKIvDoBtsL4WLGsNRk/view) – download it right away.

It is a password-protected 7ZIP file. You’ll get the password from the portal when the ROE is open.

Download the software to open it from [Download](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) for your OS and practice using it. (We won’t be teaching you that ![:slight_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/slight_smile.png?v=12 ":slight_smile:")

The ROE is impossible to complete on time. Focus on questions you can solve quickly.

There is no negative marking. Guess randomly at the end.

Your AIPROXY Token will be topped up and you will be able to use it for the ROE. But if your Internet connection is flaky, don’t waste time on that question.

Best of luck for a very hard exam!
