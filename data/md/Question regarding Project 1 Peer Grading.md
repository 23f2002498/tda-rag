Amodh,

Its a peer review. So its totally up to you. We have given the guidelines on the project qualitative pages. There is never going to be a perfect answer for this question. You have to make a call on what details to put in and if its good enough or not. Try to follow the guidelines that are given. Making a visualization and explaining it is an art not a science. There are some metrics which will guide you, but beyond that there is not much else I can give you because what I want to see might not be what someone else cares about. My standards for what I expect are generally higher than what the average student body produces. You should come up with what you feel is a appropriate given all the advice thats given in various sessions and even there were useful suggestions given by other courses and by students.

Then make a call on what you feel is appropriate given the guidance you have received.
