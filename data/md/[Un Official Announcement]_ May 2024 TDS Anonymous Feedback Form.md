Dear Students,

Amit and myself, were your TDS TAs for May-24 term. We know that everything did not go smoothly as we hoped. In a few days, we will have a meeting with the course instructors and the professor so we need your feedback to show them the right picture about this course.

This feedback form is **completely anonymous.** We are NOT asking for your email, roll no. or name. **Your email-id is NOT recorded**. You can also open this form using the incognito tab if you want. So please give us your **honest opinion.**

Changes for this term **was the result of honest feedback**:

1. Anand sir changed most GAs to make them more practical and allow you to apply and practise what you learnt.
2. Anand sir held weekly catch-up meetings with the TAs to keep up to date with the latest issues, which in turn allowed us (TAs) to respond in a timely manner to queries and problems that were raised by students through the week.
3. Anand sir was visibly involved with discourse, and had significant input in the creation of the Projects. He also gave students great bonus questions and gave valuable direct feedback to students.
4. Anand sir introduced new and relevant course content (LLMs) and removed outdated materials. This is still an ongoing process which reflects AIs growing importance to all spheres of life.

There are 3 sections to fill:

1. Content Feedback
2. Operational Feedback
3. Final Thoughts

**Thank you for taking the time to help make TDS the best subject in the Diploma.**

Your TDS TAs,

Amit and Carlton
