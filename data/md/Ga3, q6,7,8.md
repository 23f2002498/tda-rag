Dear Anju,

I have checked both questions, and I am getting the answer that is within the provided range.

GA3 is challenging. If I may be completely candid, it looks like an answer spat out by GPT. For example there is a meaningless operation  
`match = pattern.match (line)`  
Why? what’s wrong with just `line`? (assuming logs are an array of lines)  
Did you try to examine the output of a few samples of each match to see if you are actually getting the expected output at each stage of the regex?  
It might be that your regex is not performing as expected and filtering out the wrong lines. Regex is a tough and unforgiving tool to debug.

I will show how to solve this in the live TA session, and I will show a much simpler method that is humanly easily verifiable.

Someday GPT will relegate such skills obsolete… But until that day…

Yours truly,

PS: Moral of the story is its okay to use GPT. In fact we encourage it (it is the future), but please try to do some basic debugging and checks first. Use GPT in a progressive step wise fashion so that you can verifiably solve the problem. I am here to guide you on your TDS journey. I will not be able to debug GPT’s code all the time because, lets face it. GPT knows a lot more than me. It just does not have “brains”. So sometimes you need to think about what is actually happening instead of completely treating it as a magic black box. Cheers!
