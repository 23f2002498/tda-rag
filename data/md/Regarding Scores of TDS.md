The scores in the email are correct. The scores on the dashboard are correct. But the total is wrong in the dashboard. It looks like an website/operations issue. Have you checked the dashboard again? There was a problem earlier, and i was told it was corrected.

If it has been corrected then let us know. If not I will refer it to operations. On our end everything is correct. Its a portal problem.

Kind regards
