Yes you are right. Remember its not open refine but the algorithm that is causing it to happen. So it would happen even inside a python library that used the same algorithm but it would not be immediately evident and easily go unnoticed unless you were diligent about coding in some checks.

Whereas the advantage with a tool like open refine you can immediately spot the problem very quickly before it happens.
