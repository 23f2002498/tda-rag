Hi,

As there were no new content releases for the past couple of weeks, and TDS has no quizzes, we did have sessions but the content was so sparse that we decided against recording it. They were mostly quick overviews and doubt clearing sessions.

We will conduct a more rigorous treatment of the subject material with a view of preparing students for the exam closer to end term.

Kind regards
