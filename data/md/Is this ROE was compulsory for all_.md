Dear Prashant,

We make announcements in the portal AND send emails to students for a reason… The answer to your question was clearly given in BOTH of them. I am often advised not to respond to these types of questions, but then I don’t want students to think we do not read these posts. **We read ALL of them.** There are 1700 students who have taken TDS this term. If all of them did not read their emails or official portal announcements, then TDS would indeed be tedious for the 2 TAs to sit and READ and answer all these types of questions.

Please read ALL official announcements on portal and emails regarding the courses you have taken. Use google email filters to sort them into neat little buckets so that the inbox is organised and easy to find the important mails. We purposely send announcements through both channels because sometimes students miss out on one or the other. We want to give you every opportunity to not miss out on anything important. But remember TAs have to read every single post and there are only 2 of us. So a little consideration on your part would go a long way to helping everyone get the best from us.

I do hope you take my response in the right spirit and its meant for every student including the TAs because we too are students and we have to hold ourselves to the same standards. (you just got lucky to get my response ![:slight_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/slight_smile.png?v=12 ":slight_smile:") I could have selected any random student, I’m not singling out you or anyone)

Sincerely and kind regards
