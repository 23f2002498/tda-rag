Hi All,

Here are some clarifications for Project 1:

1. Company names must have only their leading @symbol stripped (the first one only), in addition to any other cleanups that have been specified.
2. Q13: You must find the regression slope of followers on the **word count** of the bio.
3. Q16: List the most common surname. If it is a tie then a comma separated list in alphabetical order of the most common surnames.

Thanks and Kind Regards
