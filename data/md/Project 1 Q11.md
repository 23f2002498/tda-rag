Hi Divyanshu,

If you *read* the Project statement *completely* from top to bottom,

It clearly states under the FILES sub-heading:

**Questions asked must be answered based on the given statename “ST\_NAME” and assembly constituency “AC\_NAME”**

This is different for each student.  
So for example in my case it a little further below under the QUESTIONS sub-heading:

L25: ST\_NAME - Punjab, AC\_NAME - DASUYA

In other words ALL your questions should be based on the given state and constituency name.

Hope that helps,  
God bless.
