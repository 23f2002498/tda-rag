Hi Eram,

I apologise on behalf of the team for the poorly spelled and unclear Insights provided in the Excel workbook.

To answer your question about what adjusted R^2 is, this is the correct definition given by IBM Analytics:

> Adjusted R^2 is a corrected goodness-of-fit (model accuracy) measure for linear models. It identifies the percentage of variance in the target field that is explained by the input or inputs.

So in the given excel sheet, if you identify the inputs, and the prediction targets, the variance of the target field is given by the Adjusted R^2

So hope that helps clear things up. Thanks for bringing it to our notice. Some of the material (like this Excel Workbook) was made a while ago and not reviewed or revised since.

Kind regards
