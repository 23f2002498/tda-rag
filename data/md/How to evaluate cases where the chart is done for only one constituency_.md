Reviews are for you to use your judgement. If there are some suggestions on your end, tag the instructors so that either they might give you some guidance regarding this or they might make adjustments on how they deal with edge cases.

TAs as far as reviews go will be examining anomalies and make the necessary interventions if the situation demands it.

Kind regards
