There were some last minute changes to GA6 and hence the delay. It makes no sense to release week 7 before week 6GA so thatâ€™s why neither have been pushed to the portal.

1/3rd of the repos did not receive sufficient reviews. Therefore, a solution was being devised for this situation, hence the delay in pushing P1 scores.

ROE scores are still undergoing checks, there is no current ETA for them.

Mails with regards to schedule changes are the purview of operations team and the instructors, the TAs have no access to the announcement or email lists.

Kind regards
