Hi Srividya,

The TA sessions cover how to solve graded assignments. If you have specific questions on GAs then post in discourse or better yet search for others that may have had the same issue, there is usually an answer for it. Also we highly recommend using Chat GPT to improve our understanding or knowledge if we have gaps. There is a big push to use LLMs because its part of the future with regards to how we learn and find information.

Kind regards
