> Hi anupam,
> The dataset has never changed. It has always been the same. Only the questions clarified and the assigned state and constituencies were reassigned. This was due to the assignments being parameterised against an older version of the dataset, hence many students (my internal analysis showed that maybe upto as much as 8 percent of the students) got ac names that were non existent or did not meet our requirements for the questions being asked.

Kind regards
