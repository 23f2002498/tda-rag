Q16 .  
AC\_NAME is a composite field and contains both the constituency number and the constituency name. We are expecting you to answer the question for the constituency within the state that has been assigned to you (for any question regarding given constituency).

Q17. Correlation questions are on a statewide basis (the mention of “include constituencies” plural should have been a big clue).

Q18. ST\_NAME is the state name (Can it be anything else?). Again this is an aggregation question where you have to examine all election years for all constituencies of a given state.
