> We have noted the issue that many students were seeing 9:00 PM as deadline when they started. The students who are affected, please do not worry, we will be providing a solution for this after discussion with course team.
> A common announcement will be released by 2024-07-26T18:29:00Z (UTC) on the redressal mechanism. And we will ensure that it is fair for all those who have submitted/missed out on RoE.
