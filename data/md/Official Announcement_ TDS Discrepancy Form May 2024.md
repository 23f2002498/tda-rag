Hi Hari,

1. We currently have left the deadline open ended until we have been given a date for final scores by the operations team.
2. GA6, P1, P2, GA4 scoring for individual answers will be pushed by tomorrow morning.
3. GA 6.2 an 6.3 solution is pair wise distance between two locations. You have to count the pairs less than the parameterised distance. The GA itself has the wrong answer key, but we do have the submissions of all students. Typically the right answer was within Â±1 of the answers shown. If thats the case you will be awarded the mark, if you selected the right answer. If the correct answer was outside the range displayed you will be awarded the mark as well.
4. (see point 2)

Hope that gives some clarity.  
Kind regards
