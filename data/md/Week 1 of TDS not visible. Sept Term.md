Hi Druv,

The most common cause are ad blockers, as mentioned in several other posts. Some browser extensions also cause this behaviour.

Use a clean browser without ad blockers and try. Very rarely it might be a network bandwidth problem (i.e. 1000s of students trying the GA at the last minute).

Regards
