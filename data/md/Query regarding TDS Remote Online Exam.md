You will be given multiple datasets in different formats.

You will have to use a variety of skills that we have covered in the first 5 weeks to extract, clean and process the data.

You will have to answer several questions regarding those datasets.

You will have to pick carefully what you choose to tackle because there will be varying difficulty to the questions (in no particular order). Watch TA sessions for maximum preparation benefit.

Use AI, or any resources and keep them handy in bookmarks or collected somewhere so you can quickly use them to solve questions.
