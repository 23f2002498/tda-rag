Hi Viraj,

The reason for GA0 is simple. It gives you a flavour of what you need to be comfortable with in order to be able to do well in the course. Generally if you are struggling with these basics (because that is what they are), then you will have to put extra effort in order to get up to speed. TDS covers a lot of ground in terms of the tools used for Data Science. Past experience shows us that students who are not comfortable with the basics find the Remote Online Exam very challenging and many score 0.

So the GA0 gives you a chance to assess if you want to “bite the bullet” and take the course or do you want to give yourself some time to become familiar with the basic requirements. We do this early so that you can still avail the drop window, if you find the the course challenging.

We (the TDS team) have lobbied hard to actually have some concrete (programming) pre-requisites for this course, but the BS management (not the TDS team) has countered with, this is not possible because some students only do the Data Science Diploma. I totally agree that these requirements must be made known prior to taking this course. However due to an impasse on how to structure the diploma, to better deal with this issue, it is what it is. I know this is not of much comfort. Having said that, you also have one of the best professors and I dare say with the backing of data (some of the best TAs) in the program who are here to help you succeed. But it will require much effort compared to most other subjects.

Students who have been through TDS can mostly vouch for one thing. Its one of the most interesting, practical and useful course in making you job ready. But it is a trial by fire. However if you have done the diploma in programming, its fairly easy (which is why we always recommend taking it towards the end of the diploma).

Hope that helps.  
Kind regards
