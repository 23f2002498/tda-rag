For the qualitative analysis:

Plot the trend of age distribution of candidates over time. Write one strong inference from this chart.

The subset of data that I am working with has only 10 rows containing age of the candidate spread across a paltry 2 elections. In other words, woefully insufficient information to make a meaningful chart from. Any guidance on how to go about it? The only reasonable inference I can make is that there is insufficient data to make an inference.

Thanks for any guidance/clarification/advice.  
God bless
