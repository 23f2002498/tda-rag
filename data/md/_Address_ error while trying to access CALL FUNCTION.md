Hi 23ds300016,

My personal diagnosis: Without seeing the addresses object its impossible to know. The error it self says that the `address` key does not exist in the `addresses` object.  
Print `addresses` to diagnose the cause of the error.

Course Recommended method (Use AI to diagnose the problem): Try putting the error in ChatGPT to see what it says.

Kind regards,
