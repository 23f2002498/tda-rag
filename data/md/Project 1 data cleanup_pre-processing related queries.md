Hi Yazad,

In the TA Session conducted on 7 July, we spent a good amount of time on discussing what noise could be there in the dataset and what is definitely not there. Please watch that session, your fellow students came up with an impressive list of possibilities and at least two of those types are included in this dataset. The noise is also not something that is subjective, it was carefully chosen to be completely objective. It has no relevance to judgement, but rather carefully examining the data for anomalies. Beyond that I cannot tell you because otherwise there is no point in the exercise if we told you what it was.
