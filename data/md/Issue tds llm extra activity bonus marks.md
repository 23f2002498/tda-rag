Hi Divansh,

I can understand your confusion. That was a copy paste of the discourse thread post where the bonus questions are always posted. The thread being referred to indicates that you would have to reply to that discourse post itself in order for the submission to be considered valid. However, the email clearly states donot\_reply. So its a bit strange to reply to a donot\_reply email address?

I have informed [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) as he has discretion on the marking.

Kind regards
