That makes no sense. Why would a single party split its vote in the same constituency, it would nearly guarantee a loss as India has a first past the post electoral system.

If you are talking about IND. Thats not a party. That is an independent candidate. Therefore there can be many independent candidates. So each independent does not aggregate with another because that makes no sense. Unless you were answering the question, How well did independent candidates as a whole voting block do in the election?
