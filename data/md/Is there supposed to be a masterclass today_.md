[@Nithish\_Kumar](/u/nithish_kumar) sir,

I got an email saying that this Monday there will be a start of a new series (Master class) for tools in data science. However, I have not seen anything in the calendar with links to a gmeet for such a class.

Could you kindly let me know if one is scheduled and the link to the meeting? Thanks.  
God bless.
