Without knowing how you obtained the csv, its impossible for me to verify your code is correct.

Is the Csv clean? A common mistake is assuming that the conversion from pdf to csv is without any anomalies.

There is an error in the conditions you used. It does not match what was asked in the question.

Also what is in row 1499? (will help verify that you have the right rows, though it will not account for anomalies at the pg breaks which may affect your sums)  
`| 69 | 43 | 75 | 52 | 39 |`

Kind regards
