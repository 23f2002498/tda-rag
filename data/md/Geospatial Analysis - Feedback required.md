Hi Kartik Mittal,

Great work with the data collection, processing and visualisation. Here are some suggestions for improvements.

1. You should give references for where you obtained the data. This helps the reviewer to know if your sources are reliable. eg. market valued at over **$145 billion** (when was this and where did you get this data) What is the market value in India/Bangalore? etc.
2. The data you used for the population was 2011, is the data for the stores also from 2011? If you mix and match data from two different timescales, is the conclusion valid? Have you used projection or data from more recent sources that project reliably the population in the districts as it stands today?
3. The heat map requires a legend indicating which areas are high population vs which are low.
4. Show only each vendors distribution when doing the conclusions. Otherwise its difficult to see how you reached those conclusions.
5. Are you able to create an interactive deployment for the visualisation, so that users can explore your creation?

Its a great display of how to use all the various data tools to create a visually compelling story.

Kind regards
