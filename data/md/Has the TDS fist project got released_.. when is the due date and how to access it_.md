Hi Abuhashir,

In the TA session on July 4, we covered how to deal with parquet files and missing library errors. The video will be shortly uploaded.

Typically you should be able to read parquet files directly using pandas as long as the pyarrow library has been installed.

Typically this is the workflow on VSCode and it should not be too dissimilar on google colab.

As you can see there is no need to specify the engine, just a straight forward pandas read.

Kind regards
