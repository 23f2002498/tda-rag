The live sessions of the TAs are recorded. We have already handed them over to the Ops team. As soon as the TA sessions are reviewed by the Ops team, they will be pushed to the TDS channel. We do not have the permissions to stream them directly onto YouTube unlike instructor sessions, which is why instructor live sessions are usually available in real time or immediately thereafter.

In the meanwhile if you have specific questions on course content, you can always use discourse to post them.
