No Azhaan, I am not saying the project page will show a value between -1 to +1 as correct (because that depends on the dataset you uploaded if there are any errors or edgecases that have not been checked). What I am saying is the CORRECT answer will be between -1 and +1. It has to be. Its the mathematical definition of correlation.

Also when you are asking for help you should tell what dataset you are working on.  
Aka city and followers parameters.
