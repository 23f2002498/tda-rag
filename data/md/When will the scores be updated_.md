For nearly 700 submissions each dataset taking 120 seconds, for 5 datasets running task in parallel within the organisation limits, it will take a minimum of 4 days, running it on the server 24/7.

The evaluate.py was just a guide to iron out any major issues with your submission. It was never meant to be the actual script that does the final evaluation. We thought it would be kinder to students to give them a chance to see whats wrong before the final submission.

Kind regards
