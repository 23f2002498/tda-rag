This is most likely because you are not using the documented api endpoints. It was explained in earlier live sessions that we provide you with a key with sufficient credit to complete your assignments. But the mechanism we employ is to use a proxy. Please carefully follow the instructions in the session or on the aipipe documentation that is available on module 3 first page.
