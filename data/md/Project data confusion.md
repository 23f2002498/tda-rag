Hi Amogh,

There are deliberate manipulations of the data. But the manipulations are objective. Not subjective. Therefore it can be cleaned up with clear logical reasoning and thinking.

This is why spelling differences are to be considered as different entities (regardless of if they are constituencies or candidate names). Because that is a subjective decision ( unless one takes the time to investigate it with the election office, which is not what we are expecting students to do.)

However we are expecting students to clean up the objectively introduced manipulations. This was clearly mentioned in the instructions. (Something most students unfortunately ignore and will likely lose most of their project marks due to this tragic oversight).

Kind regards,
