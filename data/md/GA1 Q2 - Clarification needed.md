Hi Rajyalakshmi,

I have looked at your exact txt file and it works perfectly fine on my system. I am not sure why the file you downloaded has this issue. Did you make any modifications after viewing it and accidently saved it?

This is what your text file looks like when I open it.

Try downloading the file again is what I would suggest.  
If all else fails you can download it from this temporary location (though I would recommend that you download it from your GA itself.)
