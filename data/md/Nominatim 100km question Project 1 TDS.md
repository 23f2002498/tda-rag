Hi Rahul,

Thanks for example, as I mentioned in the video “maybe its possible”. In other words I did not know either. It would be an interesting exercise to see the average number of constituencies within a 100 km distance for the whole country (while within the same state) for each state. The ones on the borders of the state are likely to have around half or less than half the ones that are in the middle. So then its possible to see if the data actually supports my hunch or am I completely off base with regards to whether 80 is a reasonable expectation for the number of neighbouring constituencies.

Maybe you could find out as you have the entire dataset of states and constituencies available and let us know what you find.

Kind regards
