Hi Anupam,

There is nothing wrong with the script. EVEN if you answer one answer correctly, it still means you have wrong answers for the rest of them. Therefore the script correctly states that your submission has wrong answers. In other words it does not tell you which answers you got wrong.

Hope that gives clarity. (Unlike in the past where you could just submit one at a time until you get all the answers correct. You will not be able to do that with the current script).

Kind regards
