#### 1. Project submissions which were in the wrong index order, i.e. you did not follow the rule regarding order of questions:

Resolution: We will consider all submissions of questions in any order. If you have answered the question correctly we will award you the marks regardless of the order in which you submitted the questions.

#### 2. Test run submitted, but the CSV was not submitted:

Resolution: We will consider your test submission if you were not able to submit the csv normally.  
You will get an email with your marked responses.

#### 3. GA4 missing responses:

Resolution: We will push the marked responses to the portal by Thurs 29th (late afternoon)

#### 4. Discrepancy Form Deadline:

Resolution: Deadline is TBD (to be decided). Please wait for scores and portal to be updated (currently in progressâ€¦ ), before using the form, so that you will be able to report all the discrepancies properly.

Kind regards
