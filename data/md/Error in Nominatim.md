Hi Sarath,

Stick with Nominatim, this exercise is to test your use of the tools. But yes, what pops up might be unexpected. Make sure that when using Nominatim that you are using a good string that really identifies a place well for Nominatim. For example dont just give the constituency name. Try and give it as much useful information to give you an accurate result. i.e AC NAME, ST Name, country. You might be surprised that when you give it more infomation it actually might give you a better result.

Its like when I give it 39 Birch Grove Newport. It gives me a totally different location than if I gve 39 Birch Grove Newport NP182HZ. (which is the right address).

Kind regards,
