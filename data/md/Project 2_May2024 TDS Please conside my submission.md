Hi Jatin,

Its not related to the OS. Please refer to other posts that extensively deal with the issue.  
Main remedies:

1. Use a plain text editor (not google sheets, or excel, though there are work arounds for both).
2. Put strings in double quotes.

There are also other discussions surrounding submissions but they mainly have to do with how to solve the questions.

Regards
