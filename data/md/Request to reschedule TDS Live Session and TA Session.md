Hi Aditya,

I have noted your concern about schedule clashes. We find that when it is placed earlier in the day we get complaints from others that prefer to have it in the evening and vice versa. Ideally it would be better if the scheduling involved getting a poll from students about ideal times before actually creating a schedule. So that way all the stakeholders have their voice heard in the matter of scheduling. This would better inform the admin team where the best good can be achieved. Of course one may claim that this would mean the “tyranny” of the majority rules over the concerns of the few. But I truly believe each and every individual ought to be valued equally. As you can imagine, trying to achieve this balance is a delicate operation. And sometimes (on rare occasions) it just downright depends administrative logistics rather than the concerns of what works best for everyone.

If we are able to accommodate your request, we will make every effort to do so. However we are unable to promise anything.

Kind regards
