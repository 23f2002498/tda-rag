Hi Aparna,

Q16 consider all years. (I.e. all unique constituencies for the given state across the entire dataset of all elections)

Q8: Count each deposit loss uniquely regardless of if the candidate was the same person. Therefore if Carlton lost the 2024 election and the 2020 election, then that counts as 2 losses.

Thanks for the question  
Kind regards
