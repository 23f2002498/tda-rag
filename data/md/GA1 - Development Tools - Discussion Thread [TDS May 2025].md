### [GitHub - sanand0/aipipe: Gives anyone access to an OpenAI/OpenRouter API...](https://github.com/sanand0/aipipe/)

Gives anyone access to an OpenAI/OpenRouter API key free at 10 cents/week. Self-hostable. Useful as a backend if you're building pure front-end LLM apps

You can use the AI Pipe Token from [aipipe.org/login](http://aipipe.org/login) in any OpenAI API compatible application by setting:

OPENAI\_API\_KEY as your AI Pipe Token

OPENAI\_BASE\_URL as <https://aipipe.org/openai/v1>

eg. (in Linux BASH)

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_aipipe_token_goes_here

```

```
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://aipipe.org/openai/v1"

```

Then if you have `uv` installed

> **Note:** ~~The tool previously named `uvx` is now `uvenv` due to a naming collision with a new `uv` command. The new name better reflects its purpose, combining `uv` with `venv` .  
> Itâ€™s been used here so that those who are familiar with `uvx` can understand the below command. It is always good practise to migrate away from deprecated tools to newer maintained ones because deprecated tools are easy targets of open-source supply chain code injection attacks.~~  
> `uvx` is not the same as the python library uvx. `uvx` here is a command within uv.

```
uvx openai api chat.completions.create -m gpt-4.1-nano -g user "Hello. Give me 5 names for a pet dog."

```

or

```
uvx llm 'Hello. What is 2 + 2?' -m gpt-4.1-nano --key $OPENAI_API_KEY

```
