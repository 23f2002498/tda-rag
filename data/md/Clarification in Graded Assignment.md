> Hi Akash,
> We will conduct a review of the issue with the team. There are a few others that have similar issues.
> The general rule (as I understand it) is if the chosen option redirects to the correct site, then the redirected final location is the correct answer. This is easy to see why, I could have setup a redirect domain to point to the correct site (or worse, to a spoofed version of the official site but with dangerous malware). This is why any answers that “redirect” will not be given mark…

Thanks,  
Kind regards
