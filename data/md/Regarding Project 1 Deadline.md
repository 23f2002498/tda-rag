**Current Project 1 Deadline : 21st July, 2024 23:59 IST**  
(accurate at the time of this post)

The whole TDS team discussed the extension of the deadline of Project 1 with the instructors this morning July 17th again with direct reference to your post. [@dibujohn](/u/dibujohn) [@iamprasna](/u/iamprasna) [@Amit1](/u/amit1)

**The instructors were in complete agreement and unanimous** in their decision that there would be no extension to the deadline of Project 1 as it was already taken into consideration when the project release was delayed.

However, because of ongoing OPPEs around that date, the operations team raised the issue that there may be portal access issues for some students who might be waiting till the last minute to do their submission (we always advice strongly against last minute submissions). So there might be a day added if it is deemed necessary to allow *for operational reasons only*.

I hope we have given you and other students sufficient clarity about the granular decision making that goes into every aspect of this course.

Kind regards
