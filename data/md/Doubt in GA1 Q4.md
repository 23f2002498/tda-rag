Try cross checking with google sheets. See if by using filters you can arrive at the same list. Use ls -l. Then copy into google sheets. Convert text to columns. Use filters. And then check. If the lists are different try to see why they are different and see if you can spot the difference between the list your script produces vs what it should be.
