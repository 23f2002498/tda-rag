this is very good reason to work in wsl instead of directly on your local machine. git bash I presume is a direct install on windows (a bash terminal for windows). bash is a very powerful tool and has to be used with care. unless you really know what you are doing, it is far better to work in isolated VMs like wsl or other similar setups or containers. It may be recoverable, but for future make sure you have regular backups of your work in the cloud like on OneDrive or Google Drive. Then recovery from fatal erasures is trivial.

As far as how to recover the files totally depends on what happened and if you have any recovery systems in place. It is hard to give generic advice without knowing your system. If there is Roll back or File History in your system it is quite possible to recover the files. Or if your work is all within OneDrive for example.

Kind regards
