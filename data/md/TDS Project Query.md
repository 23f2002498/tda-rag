Hi Amogh,

Yes everyone gets the same dataset (i.e legislative elections of all states and constituencies). However, each person gets a specific subset they are supposed to work with.

In your example you have to use Madhya Pradesh and AC\_name of Morena to answer the questions given to you. You have to scrape the all the election data from that subset.
