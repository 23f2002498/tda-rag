Hi Bhavya,

You have to logically decipher what does 30 THIRUVALLA, 99 THIRUVALLA, 105 THIRUVALLA represent. As this is an objective logical question, you will have to come up with a logical answer and we will not be able to answer this question for you (As there is only one logical answer to that question if you really examined your dataset carefully and came up with the obvious interpretation).

1. Is it logical to count the same constituency twice when the question is how many constituencies are within {xxx} kms? We do not try to deliberately confuse students, as far as possible we try to be very clear with our questions.
2. Did you look carefully at what the question is **precisely** asking?

Regards,
