Hi Rashikak,

The expectation is to show how you got the data for your graphs. In other words, how does anyone know if the graphs are real or made up? So explaining the steps with screenshots in a google document or using an annotated Google colab (with permissions enabled for viewing) or pdfs, such that a reviewer can recreate the steps you took to get the same result as you show in your graphs.

These are just suggestions. Ultimately its your peers who will review your work, based on the metrics that will be given. So the more clarity the better.

Kind regards
