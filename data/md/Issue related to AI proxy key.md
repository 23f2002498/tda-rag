Unless you provide the code (and by the way you ought to post in the official discourse thread), it is impossible for us to give you definitive help. Most likely its because you are calling the wrong endpoint. You have to refer to the AIProxy documentation and call the appropriate endpoint with your issued key.

Kind regards
