Hi [@23ds2000116](/u/23ds2000116),

We will be sending an official gform for all marks disputes. But meanwhile I had a chance to personally check your week 3 submission. You specifically got Q3 and Q4 wrong. We personally validated your question with our own answer scripts as well as the official answer key. Therefore you have received the correct marks for Week 3. You got exactly 8/10 questions correct. Week 4 frontend display is currently a system wide issue for TDS. The marks and submissions are all visible on our end. Hope that clears things up.
