For Project 2

Its the pretty much the same as we see in Maths 2 and Stats 2. Therefore its very much like our expectatations and see no strange artifacts.

While some might feel otherwise, we are very confident in the random samples we examined (including those that complained), about how robust and surprisingly fair the evaluator was.

It did a phenomenal job, i would even go so far to say its fairer than the peer review system that was prone to wildly varying quality, non reviews that caused enormous backlogs to scoring due to students being unreliable.

I think we could have done a better job communicating the evaluation process, but what students fail to appreciate is how cutting edge this all is for you and for us. You should be proud of what you have learnt. You may not realise it but you now belong to an elite group on the bleeding edge of data science.

For Project 1,  
Although i do not have the graph, students scored better in Project 1, so the median moves to the right.

Kind regards
