Hi Shiwani,

Please watch the session on web scraping conducted by Amit. We will also be doing some extra sessions in the week leading up to ROE to help practise scraping.

This is a good reference for the requests library.

r.json () in the above screenshot example retrieves the json from the request response.  
This comes as a dictionary key:value pair.

Kind regards
