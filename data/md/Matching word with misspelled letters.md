Hi Akash,

Only use the AC name that you have been given. Consider misspellings as being a different constituency for this exercise.

But thanks for bringing it to our attention, we cleaned up over 1000 misspellings (out of nearly 7000 unique constituencies), but this one somehow escaped our notice.

Kind Regards
