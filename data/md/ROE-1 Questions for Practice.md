We do not hand out ROE questions, but you have the datasets, so its easy enough to get questions from others **or create your own that you feel would be interesting.** Part of being a data scientist is producing interesting insights from data sets. Sometimes clients themselves might not know what question to ask, so being able to develop your own questions or answer a theory and testing it with on the data you have available is a real world skill. For example with the school database, for me an interesting question to answer would be do school meals make a difference to scores? And if they do where is the effect more pronounced? My theory would be schools in affluent areas might not see any benefit from school meals and perhaps in inner city areas there is a bigger effect. Or even reverse the question find schools where it is making an impact and find what links those schools together. This is just a random example. You can do that with all kinds of data that is available in the real world.

Kind regards
