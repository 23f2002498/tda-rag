So what happens when you clear the network log, And you start typing the city name in the search bar (before you press enter)? There should be some asynchronous calls being made and it will show up in the network log.Can you post the screenshot? As you type there should only be 2 or 3 calls being made. Also make sure you are not viewing all, in the filters, just the Fetch/XHR
