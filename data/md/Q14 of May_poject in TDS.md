Hi Albert,

The question is sufficiently clear.

You need to logically breakdown the questions, this is an important skill.

There is no ambiguity in what is asked in this question.  
Hint: there are two filters and a computation

Read the wording of the question carefully and answer exactly what is asked.

Regards
