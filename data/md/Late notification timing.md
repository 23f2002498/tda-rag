The TDS self-evaluation test functions as a tool for students to assess their preparedness for the TDS course. Itâ€™s crucial to understand that the results of this test do not contribute to the final grade or score. Instead, its primary aim is to offer insight into the essential skillset required for students already enrolled in the TDS program. Please note that the evaluation test will be rescheduled to Monday, February 5th, at 8:00 PM.
