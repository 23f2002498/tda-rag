My take on it would be margin of victory would then be negative. Because winner always has a positive margin. Losers have net negative margin against the victor. Winning the election by a margin of 10 points over the loser means that loser has a 10 point loss against the victor.

The real trouble is what to do with independents. Currently there are two approaches (aggregation and considering them as 1 party which then poses its own problem if the independent candidate won OR discard independents and focus on only parties, which also poses less of problem if an independent won because you are still plotting only the trajectory of a party.)
