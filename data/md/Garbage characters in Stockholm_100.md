Also remember whenever you start to use Excel or some other spreadsheet software they often tend to mess with the encoding etc. and the end saved result is rarely a pure CSV.

You can use whatever tool you are comfortable with. I would highly recommend to try different approaches such as using Google Colab and/or VScode and/or Javascript etc. Each has its strengths. Programmatic approaches work much better especially when the datasets get large. So I advice getting comfortable with using various tools.

Kind regards
