Did you try what [@22f3003031](/u/22f3003031) mentioned? As in

1. change the values in your .csv to the right values, then
2. upload the new files to your repository,
3. then resubmit the answers with the new repo details?

Because the Check Answers does validation on your own dataset that you upload. If the spec is not followed EXACTLY as mentioned the script will give you erroneous results.

Kind regards
